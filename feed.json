      "content_html": "<h1>🇱🇰 Sri Lanka This Week</h1>\n<p><em>Generated by <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5\">gpt-5</a> from </em><em>175</em><em> English News Articles published between </em><em>2025-10-31</em><em> &amp; </em><em>2025-11-07</em><em>.</em></p>\n<h2>Sri Lanka pivots from stabilisation to growth, but credibility now matters as much as momentum.</h2>\n<p>A year after averting default’s aftershocks, Sri Lanka is trying to move from IMF-led stabilisation to investment-led expansion. Markets have noticed: the CSE’s ASPI hit a record <strong>23,000</strong> and corporates posted muscular results (John Keells’ Q2 EBITDA up <strong>127%</strong> to Rs. <strong>18.36bn</strong>; NDB’s 9M pre-tax profit up <strong>62%</strong>; HNB Assurance Life GWP up <strong>38%</strong>). Foreign-facing firms are leaning in: Colombo Dockyard signed its largest-ever order to build two cable ships for Orange Marine; Rakuten Symphony and SLT-Mobitel will run one of South Asia’s first Open RAN trials; M&amp;A continues (SolarIT acquiring Tetris; JAT Exports buying Mirotone NZ for A$ <strong>4m</strong>). Yet none of this will carry far if institutions stumble. Allegations around the release of “309 containers” at Customs, police procurement leaks and politicised extensions jar with the Government’s reform message. Investor confidence is rising; policy credibility must keep pace.</p>\n<h2>The Budget should lock in certainty on tax and tilt policy from collection to compliance, affordability and growth.</h2>\n<p>With the 2026 Budget upon us, the market wants fewer surprises and steadier signals: maintain fiscal consolidation but reduce the cost of doing business, deepen listings (including SOEs), and ease foreign re-entry. On taxes, several voices urge pragmatism: introduce credits for firms that digitise (e‑invoicing, ERP, cyber‑security), a simplified presumptive regime for the service gig economy (3–5% on gross receipts) and a real‑time taxpayer dashboard to cut friction. Others caution that tax morale depends on fairness: keep rates and thresholds steady while using data to widen the net and improve enforcement—without tipping willing payers into non‑compliance. The lesson, as one analyst put it, is simple: growth needs macro prudence, but prosperity needs micro predictability.</p>\n<h2>The state’s anti-drug push is sweeping, but long-term gains will come from justice-system throughput and rehabilitation.</h2>\n<p>The Government has launched a high‑profile drug offensive—nearly <strong>1,000 arrests</strong> in a day, deep-sea seizures (≈Rs. <strong>5 bn</strong> worth), and a new operations centre to fuse police, military, Customs and immigration. The hotline (1995/1818) and a turn to voluntary treatment are signs of a broader intent: from fear to prevention. The risk is familiar: dragnet arrests that clog courts and prisons, while upstream networks adapt. Sustainable progress needs measurable targets—kingpin convictions, asset forfeiture, fewer youth initiations—and insulation from politicisation. The state must also fix what it demands of citizens: due process, clean procurement, and no impunity for collusion.</p>\n<h2>The Northern economy is back on the policy map; turning potential into exports demands ports, power and people.</h2>\n<p>A drumbeat of analysis and advocacy (think‑tank papers, business forums and an announced Northern Summit in January) frames the North and East as Sri Lanka’s “Northern Gateway”—close to Indian markets, rich in fisheries and agriculture, with ports (KKS, Point Pedro) and the Palaly airport as anchors. Private and diaspora capital are awakening; public policy should follow with hard infrastructure (cold chains, last‑mile logistics, grid capacity), streamlined land use and cross‑border services. The blue economy is the obvious fulcrum; governance (traceability, IUU control) is the hinge.</p>\n<h2>Tourism’s recovery is labour‑constrained; fix skills, not just visas.</h2>\n<p>NHRDC’s new data are stark: hotels face shortages in kitchens (<strong>35%</strong>), F&amp;B (<strong>22.8%</strong>), and housekeeping (<strong>16.6%</strong>); women are just <strong>24%</strong> of the workforce; over <strong>60%</strong> of exits (2020–23) were to overseas jobs. Training pipelines are skewed (3,000+ in cookery vs. &lt;200 in guest relations) and curricula behind the curve (multilingual skills, digital hospitality). Retention will demand structured apprenticeships, flexible shifts, safer workplaces and career ladders—especially for women. If Sri Lanka wants higher‑yield visitors, it must first invest in higher‑skill service.</p>\n<h2>Climate and circularity inch from CSR to core, but policy coherence lags.</h2>\n<p>Corporate moves are getting bolder: Allianz Lanka tethers policy sales to ecosystem restoration (PLANT), Bureau Veritas wins Gold for environmental performance, and GP Labs opens the country’s first dedicated plastics testing facility to validate recycled materials to ASTM/ISO standards. Yet public policy sends mixed signals. The bag levy (Rs. <strong>3–5</strong>) may curb demand, but without ring‑fenced revenues for collection and recycling infrastructure it risks being a regressive fee. Likewise, a proposed Hambantota refinery raises unresolved EIA, coastal and biodiversity risks. “Eco” should be engineered as a system—products, recovery, data—not just priced at the checkout.</p>\n<h2>Foreign policy is pragmatic and plural; it should be married to trade facilitation and investment execution.</h2>\n<p>Sri Lanka’s external calendar is busy and balanced: Korea marked <strong>48 years</strong> of ties (diaspora, KOICA, EPS labour); Archbishop Gallagher’s visit celebrated <strong>50 years</strong> with the Holy See; Tokyo and Seoul welcomed new envoys; Bangladesh FOC and the UAE Joint Commission relaunched after long lulls; the Sri Lanka–Thailand Business Council renewed its agenda as both sides work an FTA. These are good optics. The test is throughput: concluding legal instruments, accelerating approvals, and de‑risking projects with transparent PPP frameworks. Diplomacy feeds pipelines; domestic capacity must close.</p>\n<h2>Telecoms, shipbuilding and open standards hint at a productivity turn—if the digital divide is addressed.</h2>\n<p>Local manufacturing and network innovation signal movement up the value chain: Colombo Dockyard’s high‑technology vessels for Orange Marine; Open RAN trials to cut vendor lock‑in; and private investments in agritech cold chains and boutique wellness real estate. The IPS 2025 report argues the case: digitalise to reduce trade frictions (e.g., EU deforestation rules), and put smallholders on shared platforms (GIS, blockchain traceability). That will need public rails (payments, identity, data protection), skilling and last‑mile access—plus a regulatory posture that promotes competition without deterring capital.</p>\n<h2>The capital market is doing its job; policymakers must avoid crowding it out.</h2>\n<p>A record market, oversubscribed IPOs (e.g., JF Packaging), and strong bank fee growth point to risk appetite returning as rates ease. To convert rallies into reform, the state should stick to a predictable issuance calendar, resist ad‑hoc tax tweaks on equities, and sequence SOE listings that broaden the investable universe. Pension funds will need clear, rules‑based room to allocate to equity; foreign investors, clean exits and credible macro anchors.</p>\n<h2>Governance will decide whether reform compounds or unravels.</h2>\n<p>The Government is moving on several fronts—youth entrepreneurship committees in Parliament, cross‑border energy talks with India, and an integrated forest‑crime unit (Wana Surakuma) with <strong>1995</strong> hotline support. It is also under scrutiny for politicised appointments, Customs controversies and attempts to stretch tenures. The simplest growth policy remains the hardest: enforce rules without fear or favour, publish the findings, and show that the “new” state is smaller where it should be—and stronger where it must be.</p>\n<h2>The story of the week: Sri Lanka is back on investors’ screens; to stay there, it must make institutions boring again. 🧭</h2>\n<p>There is clear, broad‑based momentum—corporate earnings, market highs, trade missions, and a more assertive green agenda. The risks are equally clear: skills shortages, policy whiplash, enforcement optics, and an overstretched justice pipeline. Growth needs capital; capital needs confidence; confidence needs competent, rules‑based government. That is the compounding Sri Lanka should be aiming for.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nuuuwan/lk_news_digest/tree/main/data/history\">Previous

      "content_html": "<h1>🇱🇰 Sri Lanka This Week</h1>\n<p><em>Generated by <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5\">gpt-5</a> from </em><em>174</em><em> English News Articles published between </em><em>2025-10-24</em><em> &amp; </em><em>2025-10-31</em><em>.</em></p>\n<h2>Fiscal consolidation is holding, but debt service and political theatre will shape a hard, “no-populism” budget.</h2>\n<p>Fresh Central Bank data and analyst views point to a restored primary surplus and stronger revenues under the IMF programme, even as <strong>interest costs swallow a disproportionate share of income</strong> (crowding out capital and social spend). With Budget 2026 due on 7 November, ministers are signalling restraint—more anti‑corruption infrastructure (approval of <strong>four new High Courts in Colombo</strong>) and tighter tax enforcement (an audit found the e‑Visa operator failed to remit <strong>$1.42 m</strong> in VAT/SSCL; April–August 2024 revenues were routed offshore). Markets are leaning risk‑on—bank earnings (e.g., Union Bank’s <strong>+52% PBT</strong> in 9M) and construction proxies are improving—yet fiscal space remains narrow until external debt restructuring and private‑sector credit deepen (private credit is accelerating, but the CBSL says there’s “no overheating”).</p>\n<h2>A cleaner investment pitch is emerging, but investors want fewer queues and more credibility.</h2>\n<p>Germany’s ambassador relayed that <strong>300+ German brands</strong> operate in Sri Lanka but approvals remain slow; continuity on anti‑corruption and rule of law will “unlock” more capital. Colombo is also re‑focusing maritime and logistics capabilities—from the <strong>Trincomalee naval symposium</strong> to LKI’s “Admiral’s Morning” on maritime domain awareness—while Cabinet advanced a Bill to regulate container depots and modernise shipping licences. Meanwhile, compliance is moving centre-stage: the Plantations Ministry began <strong>geo‑mapping all smallholder rubber plots</strong> to meet the EU’s deforestation rule (EUDR), with QR‑based traceability at export.</p>\n<h2>Green claims are shifting from CSR to measurable land, carbon and biodiversity outcomes.</h2>\n<p>Hayleys Plantations’ tie‑up with Solidaridad will scale regenagri protocols and “insetting” across estates, generating <strong>Carbon Removal Units</strong> for internal decarbonisation and global markets. Simultaneously, scientists and business at “Genesis by Dilmah” pressed for biocorridors, Payment for Ecosystem Services and transparent Article 6 finance to reconnect fragmented forests (Sri Lanka targets <strong>30% forest cover by 2030</strong>). The reality check is stark: conservationists say the human–elephant conflict kills <strong>~400 elephants and ~150 people annually</strong>, a governance failure linked to corridors cut by agriculture, fencing and land giveaways.</p>\n<h2>Rule-of-law optics are improving on paper, but practice is testing trust.</h2>\n<p>CIABOC is training ministries on anti‑corruption; special High Courts were cleared; and the Foreign Ministry repatriated six detained seafarers. Yet policing standards faltered when an alleged hitman in the Weligama PS chairman’s murder was filmed confessing on arrest—prompting a <strong>BASL</strong> warning that such “voice cuts” harm prosecutions and due process. Opposition parties, sensing an opening, announced joint rallies from <strong>21 November</strong>, while the SJB stayed out. The contrast with procurement clean‑ups is telling: the Cabinet awarded a <strong>seven‑month diesel supply</strong> to a Singapore trader, but energy procurement will be judged on execution, not press notes.</p>\n<h2>Tourism is rebounding by diversifying beyond the postcard South to the once‑off‑limits North.</h2>\n<p>Lonely Planet named <strong>Jaffna</strong> among its “Best Cities for 2026”, validating efforts to spread demand and spend. On the ground, micro‑entrepreneurship is widening the base: self‑drive tuk‑tuk rentals turn idle assets into <strong>c. Rs. 60,000/month</strong> passive income for owners (a high‑ROI, hyper‑local transfer), while medical wellness clinched regional honours (Christell Luxury Wellness took “Asia‑Pacific Wellness Clinic of the Year”). The flipside is standards: the e‑Visa fiasco shows how fee hikes (<strong>$18.50 service fee</strong>, including for visa‑free nationals) and off‑budget routing dent a fragile destination brand.</p>\n<h2>Social policy is inching forward with women’s protection and digital caution, but delivery will matter.</h2>\n<p>Government is operationalising the <strong>National Commission on Women</strong> (Act No. 37 of 2024), SAPRI convened a youth forum on GBV policy, and authorities plan to <strong>ban smartphones for under‑12s</strong> to curb exposure (enforcement and equity—e.g., device‑sharing for homework—will be the test). Health and education logistics also got attention: a national crop‑damage assessment is underway with pre‑approved farmer compensation caps (paddy <strong>Rs. 100,000/ha</strong>), and urgent repairs were ordered for the <strong>130‑year‑old Nuwara Eliya Post Office</strong> to blend heritage with tourism.</p>\n<h2>Reconciliation has a window, but it is finite and must go beyond symbolism.</h2>\n<p>The UNHRC’s latest resolution gives Sri Lanka <strong>two years</strong> to show progress via domestic mechanisms—while the Sri Lanka Barometer finds rising national trust but a <strong>decline in the North and East</strong>. Government land releases in Palaly are accelerating (with security caveats), and civil society marked the <strong>35th anniversary</strong> of the LTTE’s mass expulsion of Northern Muslims—arguing that devolution, truth‑seeking and reparations need delivery, not deferral. Provincial council elections and equal application of law would be tangible starts.</p>\n<h2>Exporters and manufacturers are preparing for a rules‑based, value‑driven recovery.</h2>\n<p>The CNCI Achiever Awards underlined a pivot to productivity, ESG and women’s participation, while packaging leaders used <strong>LankaPak</strong> to lobby for sensible VAT policy on inputs and invest in sustainable formats. The Colombo bourse sees steady crossings and IPO green shoots (JF Packaging), and banks are using partnerships (e.g., <strong>Sampath–NCE</strong>, <strong>HNB Assurance–BOC</strong>) and digital rails (DFCC’s award‑winning <strong>Lanka Money Transfer</strong>) to deepen inclusion. Corporate tie‑ups—from <strong>SKF</strong> bearings with C.W. Mackie to AI‑enabled reporting at LAUGFS Power—suggest boardrooms are planning beyond the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Energy, shipping lanes and external calibrations are back on the strategic agenda.</h2>\n<p>At Russian Energy Week, the Energy Minister pitched Net Zero 2050 collaboration (renewables, efficiency, skills), while Germany renewed emphasis on an open Indian Ocean and freedom of navigation. Colombo’s think tanks are turning maritime awareness into practical tools (radar, fusion centres, data). Diesel procurement is stabilising supply for the next <strong>seven months</strong>—but longer‑term resilience will depend on diversified fuels, better market design and transparent tenders.</p>\n<h2>Tourism, fashion and culture are being leveraged to project a modern, regional voice.</h2>\n<p>Under the Sri Lanka Design Festival, <strong>Mercedes‑Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka 2025</strong> is reframing “intelligent luxury” around craft, tech and sustainability, while Lonely Planet’s nod to Jaffna and a surge in experiential travel—from tuk‑tuks to culinary circuits—are broadening the map. The challenge is consistency: visa facilitation, safety, heritage upkeep and environmental protections must match the narrative if Sri Lanka is to convert accolades into durable arrivals and higher‑value stays.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nuuuwan/lk_news_digest/tree/main/data/history\">Previous Editions</a></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><code>2025-10-31</code> From Kerala to Colombo: Lessons in building gender-responsive tourism <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/columns/From-Kerala-to-Colombo-Lessons-in-building-gender-responsive-tourism/4-783698\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-31</code> Indian-funded Mahatma Gandhi Model Village opens in Ampara <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/Indian-funded-Mahatma-Gandhi-Model-Village-opens-in-Ampara/56-783697\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-31</code> Ravinatha appointed Executive Director of Regional Centre for Strategic Studies <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/Ravinatha-appointed-Executive-Director-of-Regional-Centre-for-Strategic-Studies/56-783696\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-31</code> AAIB assesses crop damage amid heavy rains <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/AAIB-assesses-crop-damage-amid-heavy-rains/56-783695\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Union Bank delivers LKR 1.2 Bn PBT for 9M 2025 <a href=\"http://island.lk/union-bank-delivers-lkr-1-2-bn-pbt-for-9m-2025/\">islandlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> CEAT Kelani wins double honours at CNCI Achiever Awards 2025 <a href=\"http://island.lk/ceat-kelani-wins-double-honours-at-cnci-achiever-awards-2025/\">islandlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Lanka Rating Agency assigns ‘A+ (f)’ Stability Rating to Astrue Money Market Fund <a href=\"http://island.lk/lanka-rating-agency-assigns-a-f-stability-rating-to-astrue-money-market-fund/\">islandlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> US Federal Reserve decision seen as impacting local stocks <a href=\"http://island.lk/us-federal-reserve-decision-seen-as-impacting-local-stocks/\">islandlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> When Faith Becomes A Cage: What A Young Muslim Athlete’s Triumph Reveals About Sri Lanka’s Crisis Of Identity <a href=\"https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/when-faith-becomes-a-cage-what-a-young-muslim-athletes-triumph-reveals-about-sri-lankas-crisis-of-identity/\">colombotelegraphcom</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Case against Ranil postponed to Jan. 2026 <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/Case-against-Ranil-postponed-to-Jan-2026/56-783671\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> CoPA flags North Western PC project irregularities <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/CoPA-flags-North-Western-PC-project-irregularities/56-783670\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Govt. sets up National Commission on Women to address issues on women <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/Govt-sets-up-National-Commission-on-Women-to-address-issues-on-women/56-783669\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Govt. to address challenges in releasing military-held lands in Jaffna-Palaly area <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/Govt-to-address-challenges-in-releasing-military-held-lands-in-Jaffna-Palaly-area/56-783668\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Lawyer arrested for aiding ‘Ganemulla Sanjeewa’ murder suspect <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/Lawyer-arrested-for-aiding-Ganemulla-Sanjeewa-murder-suspect/56-783667\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> New road safety, driver drug-testing laws to be tabled in Parliament <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/news/New-road-safety-driver-drug-testing-laws-to-be-tabled-in-Parliament/56-783666\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> LAUGFS Power partners Futurity to introduce first AI-enabled Annual Report <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/business/LAUGFS-Power-partners-Futurity-to-introduce-first-AI-enabled-Annual-Report/34-783665\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Menaka Athukorala joins Alpha Fire as new Chairman <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/business/Menaka-Athukorala-joins-Alpha-Fire-as-new-Chairman/34-783664\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> SLAP holds forum on future of printing industry <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/business/SLAP-holds-forum-on-future-of-printing-industry/34-783663\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> Global thought leaders to headline Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025 <a href=\"https://www.ft.lk/business/Global-thought-leaders-to-headline-Sri-Lanka-Economic-and-Investment-Summit-2025/34-783662\">dailyftlk</a></li>\n<li><code>2025-10-30</code> C.W.

Port City Colombo was named fDi Intelligence’s “Best Knowledge Zone – Asia Pacific,” citing its SEZ (Special Economic Zone) framework and dispute-resolution architecture. Grid reliability got a lift with Siemens and DIMO completing the country’s largest substation at Habarana, while Panasian Power tied in another <strong>5 MW</strong> solar plant in Ampara. Yet electricity unbundling is mired in dispute: CEB engineers warned Parliament that the Preliminary Transfer Plan breaches the Sri Lanka Electricity Acts <strong>(No. 36 of 2024; No. 14 of 2025)</strong> and bypasses stakeholder consultation. ♻️⚡</p>\n<h2>A digital pivot gathers pace as state and private actors seed capacity and jobs.</h2>\n<p>The state convened AI workshops for public officers in the South and staged a national AI expo with <strong>12,000+</strong> visitors, while Virtusa and UK insurer CFC launched a <strong>200-seat</strong> Colombo digital services hub. Startups secured a combined <strong>$160,000</strong> at the “First Capital Startup Nation by Hatch” demo day, and Deutsche Bank marked <strong>45 years</strong> in Sri Lanka with fresh custody accolades. Meanwhile, the Government re-gazetted institutional portfolios—moving the Civil Security Department to Public Security and clustering digital bodies (including the Online Safety Commission) under the Digital Economy Ministry—aimed at execution clarity.</p>\n<h2>Education reforms meet capacity deficits, prompting a reset toward execution and equity.</h2>\n<p>The President asked FUTA (Federation of University Teachers’ Associations) for a plan to cut degree delays and strengthen research, as Parliament heard that teacher vacancies exceed <strong>36,000</strong> (with the Eastern and Central Provinces the most affected). Cabinet approved <strong>Rs. 761.29 million</strong> to print <strong>6.04 million</strong> textbooks for 2026 and <strong>Rs. 630.2 million</strong> to locally manufacture assistive devices under the 2025–27 budget framework. A Delhi research lab was named after PM Harini Amarasuriya during her official visit, underscoring an India-facing academic bridge, while the Government faces blowback—and legal support—from the HRCSL over a proposed ban on corporal punishment (the Commission calls it international best practice).</p>\n<h2>Fiscal debates converge on credibility: consolidation must meet growth.</h2>\n<p>A raft of budget commentaries urged broadening VAT, replacing para-tariffs, and shifting from transaction taxes toward growth-friendly progressivity, warning against high cigarette smuggling (state loses <strong>~Rs. 80 billion</strong> annually) and ad hoc incentives. Analysts flagged debt-service pressure above <strong>40% of revenue</strong> by 2028 and stressed capital-spend quality over quantity, with the IMF program requiring a <strong>2.3%</strong> primary surplus. The Cabinet signaled more funding in 2026 to mitigate floods, while Parliament’s oversight committee began tracking ministry-level 2025 budget execution—an accountability move that still needs transparent quarterly KPIs.</p>\n<h2>Rule of law versus rule by law is in focus as the state pursues order without chilling initiative.</h2>\n<p>Legal scholars cautioned that over-reliance on “rule by law” (control via punitive compliance) risks a risk-averse bureaucracy; they urged measurable accountability (not simply reduced discretion) to protect service delivery. Meanwhile, a public tussle over a police–lawyer confrontation prompted calls for restraint from a former SSP, and editorial scrutiny slammed “suspect pageantry” during high-profile deportations. The murder of Weligama’s PS Chairman underscored persistent gun violence, even as CID probes celebrity ties to alleged underworld figures dominated headlines.</p>\n<h2>Reconciliation inches forward with land releases and historic reparations claims, but Geneva remains a test of delivery.</h2>\n<p>The Government released <strong>~706 acres</strong> in the North and East to the public so far this year, and survivors filed a <strong>$15 million</strong> reparations claim for the <strong>1989 Valvettithurai</strong> massacre by the IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force) at the Office for Reparations—a first-of-its-kind mass atrocity claim. The Government avoided a vote on the latest UNHRC resolution, but Foreign Ministry briefings show it rejecting the text while promising domestic action; policy analysts say credible progress—on land, graves, prosecutions, and provincial polls—is vital to unwind external scrutiny.</p>\n<h2>The green turn is real, but project governance must respect ecosystems and law.</h2>\n<p>Mannar’s wind rollout faces allegations of Ramsar and wildlife law breaches by activists, who cite bird and turtle impacts and flooding from blocked canals; they urge a moratorium pending proper EIAs and community consent. In the hills, repeated human-caused fires ravaged the <strong>38.6 km²</strong> Hanthana EPA (Environmental Protection Area), exposing weak enforcement and the difficulty of prosecuting arson under the Forest Act. Conservationists, meanwhile, celebrated the Tea Board’s GI (Geographical Indication) project—Ceylon Tea’s EU registration would protect origin and value—while Dutch Trails and Aitken Spence were honored for sustainability programs. 🌿</p>\n<h2>Social fabric strains are visible—from microfinance debt to cyber harms—requiring targeted, data-led response.</h2>\n<p>A feminist coalition warned the new Microfinance Bill could “tighten the noose” on women debtors unless predatory lending and interest caps are addressed, and called for a national debt database. The 2025 Sri Lanka Barometer found rising civic engagement but uneven perceptions of reconciliation; an online tool now opens all four survey waves to the public. On digital harms, cyberbullying cases are up, spurring calls to pair legal enforcement with school-based digital literacy and platform accountability; media ethics were also scrutinized for sensationalism around suspects. 🧩</p>\n<h2>Tourism, trade and aviation push outward—while South Asia’s trade shock demands pragmatism.</h2>\n<p>Sri Lanka courted Italians at TTG Rimini (Italian arrivals up <strong>33%</strong> y/y in Jan–Sep), Emirates launched a technician-recruitment roadshow in Colombo, and the SL–Greater Mekong council sought tighter links with ASEAN supply chains. A regional economist roundtable urged South Asia to “pivot to Asia” and decouple trade from geopolitics, as US tariff volatility pushed the World Uncertainty Index up fivefold (Aug 2024–Aug 2025); they called for domestic reforms, regional trade pragmatism, and WTO strengthening.</p>\n<h2>Markets prize strong governance signals: engineering ratings, board changes and capital market depth.</h2>\n<p>Fitch assigned Hayleys Fentons an inaugural <strong>A+(lka)</strong>, while appointments at the CSE, Lanka Ventures/LVL Energy, Lanka Realty, and others point to governance renewal. The CSE saw robust turnover (<strong>Rs. 9–12 billion</strong> range on strong days) and crossings in banking, energy, and consumer counters, though profit-taking tempered rallies. Waste-to-energy facilities co-processed <strong>~9,000 kg</strong> of illicit cigarettes (two consignments worth <strong>~Rs. 1.1 billion</strong>), feeding clean power to the grid—a small but symbolic blending of rule-of-law and circular economy. ⚖️🔄</p>\n<h2>The state’s agenda is crowded; sequencing and trust will decide outcomes.</h2>\n<p>From education bottlenecks to energy market restructuring, from flood-proofing cities to securing GI labels for export brands, the Government is advancing on many fronts. The risk is overreach without consultation: PC (Provincial Council) polls remain in limbo, key reforms lack public debate, and legal moves (e.g., child-protection amendments) have run into stakeholder resistance.

The Cabinet signalled elections to long-dormant Provincial Councils in 2026 (if necessary under the “old system”), as debate sharpened over devolution tied to the UNHRC’s latest resolution on Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, policing came under scrutiny on two fronts: the CID disclosed a caseload of “over <strong>20,000</strong> ongoing or pending investigations” (context: national backlogs), and a Mount Lavinia courthouse confrontation between a lawyer and a police constable prompted duelling allegations and raised questions about independence and restraint within justice institutions. A UN technical mission also sounded out party leaders on electoral-system support, emphasising inclusion, transparency and digitalisation.  </p>\n<h2>Anti-corruption goes digital as the bribery commission rolls out case tracking, but beneficial ownership compliance will be the next grind.</h2>\n<p>The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption launched a digital Case-File Tracking System with UNDP/Japan support to standardise workflows and statistics—an IMF governance benchmark. In parallel, the Registrar of Companies confirmed roll-out of the Companies (Amendment) Act, No. 12 of 2025: firms must identify and maintain registers of beneficial owners and file seven BO forms; non-compliance carries fines (up to <strong>4% of EU-wide turnover</strong> in the EUDR context; domestic penalties vary) and potential criminal liability. Regulators acknowledged real enforcement hurdles—layered corporate structures, offshore entities and limited data—suggesting a long compliance runway, not a sprint.  </p>\n<h2>Customs revenue peaks while policy inconsistency remains a risk signal for investors.</h2>\n<p>Sri Lanka Customs recorded its highest-ever single-day revenue at <strong>Rs. 24.9 billion</strong> (15 Oct), with <strong>Rs. 1.86 trillion</strong> year-to-date (target: Rs. 2.11 trillion) as vehicle imports resume. Yet legal disputes persist—on container releases earlier this year and LC anomalies on vehicle imports—underscoring the need for rule clarity. The BOI courted a 23-member US think-tank delegation, pitching macro-stability, logistics and zone reforms; but two sober policy op-eds argued that investor confidence still hinges on fixing six structural bottlenecks—high/hidden trade barriers, customs lag, tax unpredictability, rigid labour laws and politicised bureaucracy—rather than incentives alone.  </p>\n<h2>Colombo’s maritime machine hums louder, aided by new capacity.</h2>\n<p>The SLPA reported a profit of <strong>Rs. 32.2 billion</strong> for Jan–Aug 2025 (up <strong>71%</strong> year-on-year; target was ~Rs. 21 billion) and expects the Port of Colombo to handle a record <strong>8.2 million TEUs</strong> in 2025 (vs. <strong>7.78 million</strong> in 2024), helped by ramp-up at the West Container Terminal and transhipment diverted from the Red Sea (context: rerouting via Cape of Good Hope). Capacity is slated to double to <strong>15 million TEUs</strong> by 2026. Policy-wise, Cabinet greenlit <strong>Rs. 1.3 billion</strong> for an Excise revenue system and <strong>Rs. 1.45 billion</strong> to modernise Kolonnawa filling facilities—incremental digitisation to tighten leakages.  </p>\n<h2>Capital markets rally as crossings surge and sector earnings broaden.</h2>\n<p>Turnover exceeded <strong>Rs. 8 billion</strong> on multiple sessions; crossings spanned blue chips (DFCC, ComBank, HNB, JKH) and mid-caps (Hemas, CDB, LB Finance), reflecting deepening liquidity. The All Share dipped midweek on profit-taking, though banking, finance and manufacturing led activity; rupee hovered around <strong>Rs. 302.6–303.0</strong>/USD. IPO pipelines ticked up (JF Packaging), while energy transition plays advanced—WindForce acquired 51% of a <strong>10 MW</strong> Alankuda wind project (total cost <strong>Rs. 4.2 billion</strong>, 75:25 debt/equity). CEB unions suspended a strike after the minister accepted <strong>24</strong> proposals—signalling a fragile truce in the power sector ⚡.  </p>\n<h2>The Port City legal reset seeks predictability after incentives were repealed.</h2>\n<p>Cabinet instructed the Legal Draftsman to amend the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act (No. 11 of 2021), following repeal of strategic-business regulations on 4 Aug (those rules had codified incentives/exemptions). The aim: restore competitive certainty, align with national law and investor protections, and clarify inter-agency roles. Separately, new amendments to the Companies Act on beneficial ownership (see above) will shape KYC (know-your-customer) across Port City dealings.  </p>\n<h2>Wages and prices move: a higher minimum and selective rice imports.</h2>\n<p>The minimum monthly wage for private-sector workers rises to <strong>Rs. 27,000</strong> from 1 April 2025 (and to <strong>Rs. 30,000</strong> from 1 Jan 2026), with EPF/ETF and statutory payments indexed—narrowing real-wage compression. To ease a <strong>Keeri Samba</strong> shortage, Cabinet allowed import of up to <strong>520 MT</strong> of GR-11/Ponni Samba per importer without permits (15 Oct–15 Nov)—a targeted intervention (annual rice consumption ~<strong>2.46 million MT</strong>, Keeri share ~<strong>10%</strong>). Gold surged to records (22k at <strong>Rs. 337,600</strong>, 24k at <strong>Rs. 365,000</strong> per sovereign), tracking global moves and domestic hedging.  </p>\n<h2>Health policy balanced expansion in supply with watchdog alarm on hospital stocks.</h2>\n<p>The Health Ministry approved <strong>~Rs. 2.5 billion</strong> in procurements (epoetin for CKD patients; infliximab; antibiotics; consumables) via international bids and appeal-board vetting. Doctors’ unions warned of simultaneous oversupply of ~100 drug lines and acute shortages in essential medicines (e.g., noradrenaline, cefotaxime) and surgical items, citing fragmented procurement and regional purchases that risk leakages. On infrastructure, <strong>Rs. 5.9 million</strong> for a CIDA roof repair drew COPE’s ire over process and legality (legal costs in a staff case: <strong>~Rs. 15 million</strong>). Regionally, the WHO SEARO adopted the Colombo Declaration on healthy ageing, with Sri Lanka chairing the session and highlighting demographic pressures (1 in 4 Sri Lankans <strong>≥65</strong> by 2045).  </p>\n<h2>Environmental policy is being shaped by Brussels as much as by Colombo.</h2>\n<p>Two separate analyses of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) warned exporters—especially in rubber and rubber-based products—to prepare for geolocation, due diligence statements, and lawful-origin proofs by Dec 2025 (SMEs: Jun 2026). The apparel sector showcased tangible progress—net-zero facilities, 39% renewables at MAS, 99% landfill diversion—with UNGC engagement on circular supply chains. Locally, conservationists urged Sri Lanka Cricket to rethink a <strong>52-acre</strong> stadium plan at Mandaitivu (Jaffna), citing “blue carbon” mangrove–seagrass–saltmarsh ecosystems, flood and storm surge risks, and spatial plans marking it a high-sensitivity zone 🌊.  </p>\n<h2>Digital governance and public services had both outage warning lights and reform green shoots.</h2>\n<p>A Lanka Government Cloud (LGC) outage temporarily disrupted digital services (BMD certificates, e-revenue licenses, police clearance). ICTA said capacity relief is due from a new LGC expansion phase started in Oct 2025. Separately, the Government will sign AML/CFT MoUs with the Vatican and Mauritius (FIUs), aligning supervision ahead of FATF scrutiny. The Cabinet approved the ‘Ratama Ekata’ inter-agency anti-drug operation with community engagement—after the Navy seized <strong>~839 kg</strong> of narcotics (ice, heroin, hashish) drifting off the south coast.  </p>\n<h2>Growth hopes rest on logistics, rare minerals and re-mobilising tourism—if the rules are credible.</h2>\n<p>A research-led tourism forum argued for a pivot to higher-yield segments and stronger governance. The port/aviation build-out (Central Expressway resumption under BRI; airport runway tender retrospectives) underlines the necessity of transparent, competitive procurement. In minerals, commentators pressed for a rare earths and graphite value-add strategy, tied to updated surveys, environmental responsibility and geopolitically balanced partnerships—avoiding the curse of exporting raw sands while importing dependency.  </p>\n<h2>The social ledger: ageing, education, mental health—and air we breathe.</h2>\n<p>Education debates widened—from context-sensitive reforms in rural districts to duty-of-care for special needs and teacher deployment. Mental health advocates called for destigmatised access to care—eChannelling launched “eMindCare”—while a personal study on Kandy’s pollution noted that <strong>&gt;60%</strong> of surveyed residents reported breathing difficulties, linking emissions to poor planning. The healthy-ageing declaration (WHO) prioritised PHC-based models and financing, as Sri Lanka’s age structure shifts rapidly.  </p>\n<h2>Markets, firms and people keep building—quietly.</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline deals, companies expanded clean power (WindForce), pharmaceuticals (sterile LVPs), green reporting (ISO 14064 at CEAT Kelani), and AI-infused services (banking, marketing, customer support). Ports, telecoms and logistics registered steady gains. At the micro level, courts upheld fair use of public lakes for tourism businesses; Customs offered conditional release pathways (bonds) for vehicles with LC discrepancies; and a wrongful death lawsuit in a foreign court put safety protocols in focus across borders. The sum: a private sector adjusting to rules—provided rules are clear.  </p>\n<p>🧭 The through-line this week: Sri Lanka’s prospects hinge less on “shock therapy” than on steady, rules-based reform—clarity at ports, predictability in taxes, integrity in elections, and credibility in devolution. The numbers are moving in places (<strong>Rs. 24.9 b</strong> Customs day; <strong>8.2 m TEUs</strong> port forecast; <strong>Rs. 27,000</strong> minimum wage), but the signal investors, voters and courts all prize is the same: even-handed, enforceable rules.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><code>2025-10-17</code> C.C.A.
